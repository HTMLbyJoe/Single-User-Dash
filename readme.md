Single User Dash
================

Single User Dash replicates the look and feel of the [Tumblr dashboard](https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard), but only shows one user's posts at a time. This is useful because [some Tumblr blogs](http://HTMLbyJoe.tumblr.com) have really crappy themes that make it hard to read.

With Single User Dash, you can read any blog as if it were on your own dashboard, without following them or even having a Tumblr account! (Although you will need an [API key](https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps) if you want to install your own instance of this application)


Single User Dash was created by [Joe Anzalone](http://JoeAnzalone.com) using the [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) PHP framework and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) JavaScript framework.
